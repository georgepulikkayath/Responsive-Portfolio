      <p>Hi! my name is george.I am 25 and I live in philadelphia.Actually i come from another
            country-India where I lived for almost 23 years.I have been living in United States for 
            almost 2 years.
               I am interseted in computer science,music,sport and movies.Computers first appeared in my life when i
                was 13.Then i had got a laptop.I was palying it whenever i could.At first, I was just playing 
                computer games,but some time later, I noticed that I could do a lot more things with 
                the computer, for example programming.
                My dream is to study computer science and find a good job in IT.</p>.
